<!--It was a challenging task to write all this code. However, it was worth it. I learned some useful tips about using
header and section tags, and also the different input elements like textbox, datepicker, and combobox. This form is static.
So, no submit methods are implemented and there are no attributes in the buttons. These buttons are only links which are
supposed to perform certain tasks, and they are not form buttons.

Something funny happened: The task textbox did not appear when I first tried to display the page. I checked its html tag
and it was fine. So, I had to check all tags within the form tag to see if there was a mistake of syntax error in another
tag that is affecting it. I commented out each tag until I isolated the problem and it showed to be in the textbox, but
with no clue on its reason. So, I copied the tag from the book and pasted it under the tag in my html page and performed
a letter-by-letter comparison to find that the error was a single typo. I wrote "intput" instead of "input"! So, the
browser had the right to ignore my request to render a non-existing element :)-->
