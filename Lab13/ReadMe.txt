Dear Prof. Levi & Prof. Mahmoud,

Kindly find with this file the console and web version of the Quiz app. My notes on this lab are as follows:

Having no prior experience at all in web programming, it was very difficult for me to write the web version of this app. The console version took less than an hour, and it only took so long because of the little tweaks that I insisted on to make sure the Quiz class was flawless, since it contains the whole app logic. The web version, however, took more than eight hours, and extended on two days.

It was very difficult to know how to write actual code that fulfills a servlet with a session scope code. I understand the lecture, but there was only one example on a servlet (the hello-servlet example) and most of the time I followed the example steps without much understanding.

Most of the time I took was to understand why shouldn't I keep the data in the Quiz instance, instead of the hassle of creating and maintaining a session variable (before that, I had some problems until I casted the attribute to the Quiz type). I realized through a discussion with a colleague that the Quiz instance itself doesn't remain between different calls. So, I was convinced to save it as a session attribute and things got easier from that point on.

The control logic was a bit difficult to finish because it contained a lot of if-blocks. The output wasn't as required many times. I got an IndexOutOfBoundException once, and an OutOfBoundException another time, but those were the happiest two moments during that lab! I felt like meeting an old friend, and I was quickly able to fix the cause of these two exceptions.

I will now try to do the JSP lab.

Kindly,

Aser Ahmad
